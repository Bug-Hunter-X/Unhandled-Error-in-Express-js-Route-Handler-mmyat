# Unhandled Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that's vulnerable to issues when an invalid user ID is provided.  `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

**Problem:** The original code lacks error handling when fetching user data by ID.  If the database query fails or the user ID is invalid, the application will likely crash or return an unexpected response.

**Solution:** The corrected code includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage such scenarios, preventing application crashes and providing meaningful responses to the client.

This example highlights the importance of defensive programming and thorough error handling in building robust and reliable applications.
